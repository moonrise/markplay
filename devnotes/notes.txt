Which shell in terminals (MacOS) or command window (Ubuntu in Windows)?
* echo $SHELL
==> MacOS defaults to /bin/zsh

Maven installation in Windows Ubuntu terminal:
* sudo apt install maven

Git large file (https://git-lfs.github.com/)
* On windows, I used IDEA terminal (configured with Ubuntu) to install git-lfs (sudo apt install git-lfs)
* On the same terminal and where the project is located, run "git-lfs install" once
* git-lfs track "*.wmv"

* On Mac, brew install git-lfs, git lfs install

"git lfs pull" to download the files after clone/pull
